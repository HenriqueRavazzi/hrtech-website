// This file tells TypeScript what to do when it encounters an import for this module.
// We are declaring that the 'tailwindcss-textshadow' module exists and its default export can be of any type.
// This resolves the type-checking error without changing any of our application logic.

declare module 'tailwindcss-textshadow';
